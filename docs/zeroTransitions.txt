Having noted apparently random false results on a PiSpi8DI board I did
some investigating and came up with the following.

Below is output recording the transitions from high to low for a
digital input wired to a constant 24V AC input.

The chip does not register every zero transition, but those it does are
a multiple of 8 1/3 milliseconds apart - i.e 120 transitions per second.

Produced this by reading the device every millisecond and writing
out transitions from high to low (as the chip was configured).

Reading more frequently might have filled in the gaps but java doesn't
make a sub-millisecond wait easy.

I'd suggest - at the least - the documentation needs to make this
behavior clear to buyers.

Alternatively - referring to the schematic - removing Dx and using
LDx as a rectifier as well as indicator and adding a capacitor would
probably make it work as expected.

My main issue is that your site says this:

        The Pi-SPi-8DI has 8 inputs that can either DC or AC (Max 24 V) and are optically isolated.

It's true I guess but the results aren't the same.
